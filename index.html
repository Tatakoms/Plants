	<h1 style="color:green;">Flowers and plants make us happier!</h1>
	<p>Flowers generate happiness and improve people's moods. It's a fact being around foliage triggers responses that bounce through billions of neural pathways in the brain to inevitably inform us that,  we're feeling great. Simply take a walk around a park and notice how plant nature soothes and relaxes our human nature.Indoor plants do the same thing. Whether its a lovely palm flowing up from a container or a wall filled with living plants, being surrounding by them makes life better. </p>
	<p>Plants placed in hospital recovery rooms as well as views of beautiful gardens help patients heal faster.
